# NuGet Project
This project was created to ilustrate the creation and publishing of a NuGet Package. It has two .NET projects:

* CalcBasic - a .NET class library created to ilustrate the use of Nuget Packages. It implements the four basic math operations on integers
* CalcTest - a .NET console application that consumes the CalcBasic Package after it has been published in the nuget.org website
